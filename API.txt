    API FUNCTIONS
]]

-- Register a callback for when a player starts or stops sprinting.
-- The callback receives (player, sprinting) where sprinting is true/false.
--
-- Usage example:
-- dg_sprint_core.register_on_sprinting(function(player, sprinting)
--     if sprinting then
--         minetest.chat_send_player(player:get_player_name(), "You started sprinting!")
--     else
--         minetest.chat_send_player(player:get_player_name(), "You stopped sprinting!")
--     end
-- end)
--
-- You can register multiple callbacks; all will be called in the order registered.
-- If your callback returns true, further callbacks and default sprint handling will be skipped.


-- Cancel sprinting for a player by name (e.g., after an event).
dg_sprint_core.cancel_sprint(player_name)
